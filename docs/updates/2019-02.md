# February 2019

Welcome to the February 2019 update. In this months update we would like to highlight a couple of important changes and
improvements which we hope you will like.

## Usability and design changes in catwalk

After the launch of catwalk last month we have made several small usability improvements and design changes along with a
couple of bug-fixes.

### QlikView select excluded coloring

We have added support for the *select excluded* selection state, sometimes used when doing deeper analysis of your data
model. A value enters the selected excluded state because the value was first selected, and then excluded by a selection
in another field. This value will be described in catwalk with *green on light grey background*

!!! Note
    Please note that the color scheme follows QlikView coloring and corresponds to *dark grey and check mark* in Qlik
    Sense.

More information about Qlik's selection model can be found in the
[Qlik Sense help pages](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Selections/associative-selection-model.htm).

### Reworked top bar with new menu

The top bar in catwalk has been reworked, adding a new menu containing project wide links. Apart from the existing link
to the guide you can also navigate to the engine documents overview through *Choose App*.

### Guide for Qlik Sense Enterprise integration

Extension

## Improvements in corectl

To prepare corectl for a 1.0.0 release we improved the existing tests as well as create a plan for the remaining work.
A couple of changes has already made it into the release such as:

### Improved logging

Logging session traffic

### Support for nested objects

## Guide connecting to a local PostgreSQL

We received some questions around setting up a local PostgreSQL for test and debug of our
[PostgreSQL connector](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-grpc-postgres-connector) which prompted us to create a
[guide](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-grpc-postgres-connector/blob/master/local-postgres.md). Take a look at this
if you are starting a new project and are interested in how to quickly get up and running with Qlik Core and connectors.

## Knowledge article - Qlik Core tooling

Finally we released a [Qlik Branch Knowledge article](https://developer.qlik.com/knowledge/5c5302d4bf85ce00175efd18)
providing walk-through of our development tools, corectl and catwalk. In this we give an example of a developer flow
showing data loading, data modelling and how to analyze your data model while developing.

Give it a try and as always, don't be afraid to feedback what you like and what you are missing.

## Upcoming

In March, we will move corectl from the experimental state to a 1.0.0 release. Stay tuned!
